# Tutorials for Using Computing Systems and Simulations  
*Hall Group – Graduate Student Onboarding*

This tutorial provides a **practical introduction** to computing systems and simulation workflows used in the Hall Group.  
It is intended as a **reference guide**, not something to memorize. New students should skim it once and return to relevant sections as needed.

## How to Use This Tutorial

- You are **not expected to understand everything on the first read**
- Use this document when you:
  - Forget a command
  - Need to compile or debug a code
  - Submit jobs to HPC
  - Visualize simulation output
- Italicized text indicates placeholders that depend on your file names  
- Commands appear in `code blocks`

## 1. Basic Computing Tools (Concepts, Not Software)

Regardless of operating system or software choice, you should be comfortable with:

- Editing **plain-text files**
- Transferring files between **local and remote systems**
- Using a **terminal (SSH)** to run programs
- Compiling and debugging simulation codes

Suggested tools include Notepad++, VS Code, WinSCP, PuTTY, or native terminal tools on macOS/Linux.

## 2. File Types You Will Encounter

### Text Files
Human-readable files containing code, inputs, or outputs.

Examples: `.txt .out .err .cpp .f90 .py .readme`
